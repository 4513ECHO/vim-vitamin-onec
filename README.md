<b>
A dark Vim colorscheme with "vitamins" that promote fruitful programming and writing
</b>
</p>

## Introduction

Featuring orange, several "fruity" colors, two shades of dark grey, and one
shade of light grey, vim-vitamin-onec received its name because (i) orange, also
a fruit that contains vitamin C, is a key highlight color, (ii) the dominant
grey background has a color code of `#1c1c1c`, and (iii) it is nice to have
alliteration in the name of your colorscheme! Providing both true-color and
256-color variants, the vim-vitamin-onec colorscheme supports Vim, Neovim,
MacVim, and GVim without any configuration.
